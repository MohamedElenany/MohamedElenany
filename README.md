## Hey there, I'm Mohamed! 👋

I'm a Computer Science graduate currently pursuing a Master of Management in Analytics at McGill University in Montreal. My expertise lies in the realm of machine learning and data analytics, where I persistently push the boundaries between data and models, striving for unparalleled results. With over five years of coding experience, particularly in Python, Java, and C++, I've developed skills that bolster effective decision-making rooted in data-driven insights.

As a former Software Developer in some of the most reputable data-driven organizations in the MENA region 🌍, I was dedicated to facilitating organizations in adopting data-driven approaches, recognizing data as the pivotal factor shaping business decisions. My journey has exposed me to the transformative power of data, sparking my unwavering commitment to leverage its potential 💡.

Beyond the digital world, I have always held an unexplained curiosity for psychology and mental health 🧠. I am consistently engaged in reading books and research 📚, frequently composing my own thoughts ✍️, and drawing correlations and theories on several psychologically related topics. This enthusiasm has led me to become someone who genuinely enjoys free-form writing, with the hope that, one day, I may publish my own book to aid people in discovering their path to finding oneself 📖.

As a fun fact: I'm a dedicated football enthusiast, supporting Al-Ahly, Africa's finest, ⚽ and Real Madrid, Europe's top contender 🏆.

Let's connect and embark on this exciting journey together! 🌟
